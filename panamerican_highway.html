				I am writing this from our "appartment" in Ushuaia we are sharing with our friends from Mexico. Such a wave of relief, disbelief, exhaustion, stress, thankfulness, and so many more feelings have been washing over me the last few days as we rest and recover. This trip has definitely been the most challenging thing I have ever accomplished in my life. Sometimes it is easy to think it wasn't that hard -- all we had to do was ride a motorcycle a few hours a day south until we arrived. But it was so much more than that. This trip had both its physically challenges, but also its mental challenges - mainly centered on endurance because there were very few single issues that gave us a hard time. We reached the Artic Circle in Alaska 474 days ago, which marked the beginning of our journey south. Looking back through the 15 countries we have crossed on our way south and everything we have had to deal with every single day... it really reminds me of grandeur of this accomplishment.
